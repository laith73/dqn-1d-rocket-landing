# Project Description

An agent and an environment were implemented for reinforcement learning purposes. The environment simulated a 1D rocket landing with a 2D state vector that contains the current velocity and altitude, and scalar action, which is the thrust force applied. For the agent, DQN was chosen due to its suitability for continuous input spaces, which is applicable to this environment and many others.
